# Troubleshooting Obscure Expo CLI Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a common scenario where Expo CLI produces cryptic error messages due to project misconfigurations.  The problem is often not in the code itself, but rather in the project's metadata files, such as `package.json` and `expo.json`.

## Problem

Expo CLI might fail to build or start a project with an ambiguous error message (e.g., `Unexpected token`, `SyntaxError`, general build failures).  The root cause is usually related to structural issues within the project's setup, rather than code errors within the application's source files.

## Solution

Carefully review your `package.json` and `expo.json` files. Ensure the project's dependencies are correctly specified and that the script configurations are valid.  Pay close attention to your asset organization to ensure it adheres to Expo's conventions.  Examine the full error output from the Expo CLI for clues, and if necessary, try simplifying your project to isolate the cause of the error.
