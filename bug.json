This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a complex or unusual project structure.  It's often related to misconfigurations in the `package.json` or `expo.json` files, or inconsistencies in the way your project's assets are organized. The error message itself might be quite generic, such as `Unexpected token`, `SyntaxError`, or simply a failure to build or start the project.

Example of a problematic `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "my-expo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "expo": ">=47.0.0 <48.0.0",
    "expo-status-bar": ">=1.4.4 <2.0.0",
    "react-native": "~0.71.8",
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  // Missing or incorrect scripts section
}
```

The actual error could be hidden deep within the build process, making it difficult to pin down.
